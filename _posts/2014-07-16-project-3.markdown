description: An app that allows users to find nature walks in their local area or create new ones. This app has full RESTful functionality and is authenticated using JWT tokens. We also pulled in forecast data from Darkskyâ€™s weather API. My role in this project was to produce custom Angular Directives using the Google Maps API to allow users to plot and edit routes. I was also responsible for user routing in the back end.
