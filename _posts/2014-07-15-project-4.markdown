description: The inspiration and overall aim for this project was to create an application to replace paper logbooks in the diving industry; an industry that is long overdue a tech overhaul. The purpose of this app is to allow users to log their dives digitally, and also allow users to add dive sites and share them so others can dive them too. Users can log in via facebook Oauth and also upload photos to the app illustrate their dive site and also their logged dives.
