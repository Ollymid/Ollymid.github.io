description: I am bordering on the fanatical when it comes to Rick and Morty, the adult cartoon series from Adult Swim. The premise of this game is that Rick needs a new Morty to replace his old one, so you have to answer 15 questions about the show or face death. The user has 3 "Morty" buttons that help them answer the questions - Mr Meeseeks(phone a friend), The Jerrify button (50:50) or Ask the Rick-dience(ask the audience). The user also collects flurbos (integalactic currency) and if they equal the high score they can keep them..
