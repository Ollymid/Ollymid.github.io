description: The premise for this app is simple - if you fall over/faceplant/do a random gravity check - you can log in to this app and record it on the map, along with a description of the event. Other clumsy people can see where the tripping hotspots are and avoid them. Users can interact on the site by leaving comments - for example, to wish a fellow user well whilst they recover in hospital.
