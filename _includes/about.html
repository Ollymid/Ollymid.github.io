                  <h4>How I got into coding</h4>
                  <p class="me">I have a natural inquisitiveness, and always try to understand how things work. At first I applied this with a psychology degree to study people. However, I currently focus it on technology, attempting to go beneath the surface of websites to see how they operate.

                  An essential thing I learnt from meeting many different people whilst travelling abroad, was that key to happiness is to pursue something you enjoy.  As someone who enjoys puzzles (I love sudoku!) and tinkering with code, a career in web development I realised, would make me very happy.

                  This strong interest in technology and desire to understand how our modern world works, led me to completing a three month web development immersive course with General Assembly. My eyes have been opened to the possibilities within web development and its real-world applications.

                  Did I mention I love building things? (especially with Lego), I am an Angular advocate and my dream job would be to work as a full stack developer, building MEAN apps that tackle current issues and relevant problems. I am also really enjoy utilizing Ruby/Rails for the backend

                  I am someone who loves puzzles and going beneath the hood to see how things work. Having had taken a few courses on Codecademy and messed around with Raspberry Piâ€™s, I enjoyed playing with technology and learning new things. But I lacked the confidence in believing I could make a living in technology.
                  However, the essential thing that changed my mind, was through travelling abroad. I met many different people, who showed me that true happiness is all about pursuing something you enjoy. I relish problem solving, so naturally a career in web development I felt realised would make me happy.
